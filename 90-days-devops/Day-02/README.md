Day 02 – Linux Architecture, Processes, and systemd

🎯 Objective
Understand how Linux works under the hood, which is the foundation for troubleshooting and managing servers as a DevOps engineer.

📘 Task Summary

Learn the core components of Linux (Kernel, User Space, Init/systemd)

Understand how processes are created and managed

Learn what systemd does and why it matters

🛠 Hands-on Work

Explored Linux architecture and components

Practiced viewing and managing processes using ps, top, and htop

Used systemctl commands to manage services (start, stop, restart, status)

✅ Key Takeaway

Linux = Kernel + User Space + Init/systemd

Processes are created with fork() and exec() and managed with PIDs

systemd is the backbone of modern Linux for service management, boot process, and automation

Understanding Linux processes and systemd is essential for efficient troubleshooting and server management
