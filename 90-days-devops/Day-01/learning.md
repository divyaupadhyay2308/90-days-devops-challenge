# *** What is your understanding of DevOps-DevOps and Cloud Engineering?

## DevOps 
- DevOps is about building systems that fail safely, recover quickly, and improve continuously.
- DevOps is about how those systems are built, deployed, and maintained

## Cloud Engineer 
- A Cloud Engineer designs, builds, secures, and maintains scalable infrastructure on cloud platforms.
- Cloud Engineering is about where the systems run

Both work together to ensure applications are stable, scalable, secure, and easy to operate.


# *** Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?

I started learning AWS in 2022. I learned the basics and cleared the AWS CCP certification in December 2022. While exploring AWS, I got curious about how applications are deployed and managed on the cloud, which led me to DevOps.
I enjoyed learning how automation, CI/CD, and infrastructure management work together, and that motivated me to keep going. Now, I work as a DevOps Engineer, applying both cloud and DevOps skills in real projects.

# *** Where do you want to reach?

Since I started with AWS and moved into DevOps, I want to grow deeper in both Cloud and DevOps. 
I want to go from just doing tasks to designing cloud setups, improving automation, security, reliability, and cost-efficiency.
In the long run, I aim to become a Senior Cloud/DevOps Engineer or Cloud Architect, managing large systems end-to-end and helping teams adopt best practices.

# *** How you will stay consistent every single day?

I stay consistent by doing something every day, even if it’s small—learning, practicing a tool, or working on a mini project.
I track my progress and celebrate small wins, which keeps me motivated. When things get tough, I remind myself of my goal to grow in Cloud and DevOps, and that helps me keep moving forward.
